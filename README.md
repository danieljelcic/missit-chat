# MissIt Chat App

This repository contains the source for the Android chat app implementation of the MissIt communication channel. MissIt is a communications interface that uses missed calls to transmit messages by modulating ringing length. This chat app is an example of a possible usage of MissIt to transmit short text messages between a combination of cost-restrained and cost-unrestrained users by utilizing MissIt's technology alongside SMS, email and similar traditional high-cost channels.
